# Personal Website Portfolio

This is a basic website I made to house more detailed explanations on my projects and research. I used the React library and deployed to github pages at

### [kylesoni.github.io](https://kylesoni.github.io/).

If you'd like to run the project yourself, download the directory and run `yarn start`.
