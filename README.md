# Personal Website Portfolio ([kylesoni.github.io](https://kylesoni.github.io/))

This is a basic website I made to house more detailed explanations on my projects and research. I used the React library and deployed using github pages.

If you'd like to run the project yourself, download the directory and run `yarn start`.
