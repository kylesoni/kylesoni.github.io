                    <p>
                        As a member of a 4-person team, I designed and built a 2D game in the Unity engine, gaining experience with C# and the Unity API.

                    <p>
                        I was specifically responsible for level design, item design, character movement, two basic enemy-types, finding online art assets, and 
                        finally implementing those assets (including the animations and parallax background). I also helped fix bugs for the inventory and block system.
